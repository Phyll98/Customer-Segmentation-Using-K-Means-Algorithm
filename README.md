# Customer-Segmentation-Using-K-Means-Algorithm

## Project Overview:
This project focuses on optimizing marketing strategies and increasing sales through customer segmentation in online retail. Using unsupervised machine learning, I analyzed a transactional dataset from a UK-based retailer (sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository) to uncover distinct customer profiles.

## Key Contributions:
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing – Managed missing values, duplicates, and outliers for a high-quality dataset.
- Feature Engineering – Created customer-centric features such as recency, frequency, and monetary (RFM) metrics, shopping habits, and spending trends.
- K-Means Clustering – Segmented customers into distinct groups, enabling targeted marketing strategies.
- Recommendation System – Developed a system to suggest top-selling products to customers within each segment, increasing engagement and conversions.
- Data Visualization & Insights – Used Python libraries (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Plotly) to interpret and present customer behavior effectively.

## Technologies Used:
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)
- Machine Learning (K-Means Clustering, PCA, Isolation Forest for outlier detection)
- Data Analysis & Visualization

This project enhances customer relationship management (CRM) by personalizing marketing efforts based on data-driven insights.
